Q3 is ForceDirected Graph Layout in D3 with node labeks

The links are colored based on the “type” field : licensing -> blue, suit -> red, resolved -> green

When you double click a node it fixes the node’s position (The pinned nodes can still be
dragged directly but they will remain in their position when the other nodes are
moved). 

A “mouseover” event on the node displays a tooltip containing the list of neighbors of the node.
